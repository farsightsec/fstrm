fstrm (0.6.1)

  * fstrm_capture: ignore SIGPIPE, which will cause the
    interrupted connections to generate an EPIPE instead.

  * Fix truncation in snprintf calls in argument processing.

  * fstrm_capture: Fix output printf format.

fstrm (0.6.0)

  * fstrm_capture: Perform output file rotation when a SIGUSR1 signal
    is received. This allows fstrm_capture's output file to be rotated
    by logrotate or a similar external utility. (Output rotation is
    suppressed if fstrm_capture is writing to stdout.)

fstrm (0.5.0)

  * Change license to modern MIT license for compatibility with GPLv2
    software.

  * src/fstrm_replay.c: For OpenBSD and Posix portability include
    netinet/in.h and sys/socket.h to get struct sockaddr_in and the AF_*
    defines respectively.

  * Fix various compiler warnings.

fstrm (0.4.0)

  * Added manual pages for fstrm_capture and fstrm_dump.

  * Added new tool, fstrm_replay, for replaying saved Frame Streams data
    to a socket connection.

  * Adds TCP support. Add tcp_writer to the core library which
    implements a bi-directional Frame Streams writer as a TCP socket
    client. Introduces new developer API: fstrm_tcp_writer_init,
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_init, fstrm_tcp_writer_options_destroy,
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_set_socket_address, and
    fstrm_tcp_writer_options_set_socket_port.

  * fstrm_capture: new options for reading from TCP socket.

  * fstrm_capture: add "-c" / "--connections" option to limit the
    number of concurrent connections it will accept.

  * fstrm_capture: add "-b / --buffer-size" option to set the read buffer
    size (effectively the maximum frame size) to a value other than the
    default 256 KiB.

  * fstrm_capture: skip oversize messages to fix stalled connections
    caused by messages larger than the read highwater mark of the input
    buffer. Discarded messages are logged for the purposes of tuning
    the input buffer size.

  * fstrm_capture: complete sending of FINISH frame before closing
    connection.

  * Various test additions and improvements.
